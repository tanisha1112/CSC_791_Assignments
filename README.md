# CSC791 - Natural Language Processing

This repository contains 2 Assignment projects for Course CSC 791 Natural Language Processing. 

### Project 1: Advanced Prompt Engineering for Question Answering

#### Overview
This project explores Language Model (LLM) comprehension, specifically focusing on prompt engineering for question answering applications. The exploration involves intricate prompt design to guide LLMs in generating accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses. The experimentation phase includes various prompt strategies, and the evaluation is performed on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset, utilizing metrics such as F1 score, Exact Match (EM) score, Bi-Encoder Score, Semantic Answer Similarity (SAS) metric, BLEU, and ROUGE Score.

#### Key Achievements
- In-depth exploration of LLM capabilities through prompt engineering.
- Comprehensive experimentation with various prompt strategies.
- Evaluation using diverse metrics for a thorough analysis of question answering performance.

### Project 2: Embedding Exploration for Event Classification

#### Overview
This project focuses on exploring different embedding techniques for event classification using a news snippet toy dataset. The two-step process involves devising an embedding scheme for training instances and utilizing nearest neighbor search for evaluation. Three embeddings, including TF-IDF as a baseline, are proposed, with an emphasis on achieving significant performance differences. The evaluation metrics include Top-1, Top-3, and Top-5 accuracy, highlighting the importance of quality embeddings over simple classification.

#### Key Achievements
- Development of an effective embedding scheme.
- Exploration of diverse distance functions for nearest neighbor search.
- Proposal of two unique embeddings, surpassing TF-IDF baseline with substantial performance improvements.
